# Edge-Computing

A dynamic machine learning based framework for Edge Computing in Video Analytics Applications. The framework intends to tie together computationally weak front-end devices with more powerful back-end helpers to allow YOLOv3 CNN to choose local or remote execution. We are working towards using current estimates of network conditions in conjunction with the Applicationâ€™s requirements. By considering specific trade-offs of deep learning models an optimal offload strategy is to be determined.

The output videos have been attached in this repository.
